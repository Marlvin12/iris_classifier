# Iris Classifier

This project is a simple Iris Classifier web app built using React and the `ml-logistic-regression` library. Users can upload their own Iris dataset in CSV format to train and test the model. The web app then displays the model's accuracy.

## Installation

Before you can run the project, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iris-classifier.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:

```
cd iris-classifier
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

The web app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

1. Open the web app in your browser.

2. Click the "Choose File" button to upload a CSV file containing the Iris dataset. The CSV file should have the following columns: `sepalLength`, `sepalWidth`, `petalLength`, `petalWidth`, and `species`.

3. After uploading the CSV file, the model will be trained and tested. The accuracy of the model will be displayed on the screen.
